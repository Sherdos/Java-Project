## Description
Develop a Java program that effectively encrypts and decrypts text messages using basic cryptographic techniques.
## Functionalities:
### Encryption:
  - Implement a Caesar cipher, allowing users to specify a shift value (key).
  - An additional encryption algorithm "Vigen√®re cipher".
  - Provide a user-friendly interface for text input and encryption/decryption options.
### Decryption:
- Enable decryption of messages using the same algorithm and key as used for encryption.

### How to run and use the programm
- Write your text that you want to encrypt or decrypt in input.txt
- Run the programm using this command ``` java Main.java ```
- Then you should to choose the cipher that you want to use
    ```
     1 - Caesar, 2 - Vigener
     Choose the cipher for enscrypt/descrypt text - {your choose}
    ```
 - If you choose the Caesar cipher then you should to enter the shifting for encrypt or decrypt
    ```
    Enter shifting for enscrypt/descrypt - {your shifting}
    ```
 - If you choose the Vigener cipher then you should to enter key for encrypt or decrypt
    ```
    Enter key for enscrypt/descrypt - {key}
    ```
 - Then choose the mode encrypt or decrypt
    ```
    Choose the mode 1 - encrypt, 2 - decrypt - {mode}
    ```
 - Your encrypt or decrypt text will be on output.txt
    ```
    Programm starting ...
    Programm finished all result safe on output.txt
    ```
